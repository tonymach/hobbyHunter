# Hobby Hunter - Unleash the Adventurous Spirit!

## Introduction

Welcome to Hobby Hunter, the brainchild of an ambitious and adventurous teenager (yes, that was me!) with a vision to make the world more exciting. Back when I was just 15/16 years old, in the midst of my 11th and 12th grade, I embarked on a journey to create something fun and exciting - an app that would connect bored young people with thrilling experiences, all at the tap of a button.

## The Genesis

I started this website from scratch and crafted it into an amalgamation of technologies, including Docker Compose, Nginx, and Django. My passion for coding and my desire to create something unique led me to develop this project. The core idea was simple: businesses could create and share experiences with young adventurers looking for instant excitement. Whether it was a random spin class, rock climbing adventure, or anything requiring minimal forethought, Hobby Hunter had it all.

## What's Inside?

Inside the Django instance, you'll find QR codes and even a MailChimp landing page integration, showing my early exploration into various technologies and integrations. I was a teenager learning on the go, and Hobby Hunter was my playground to experiment and learn.

## Lessons Learned

While Hobby Hunter never reached its full potential due to lingering issues with the codebase and perhaps a bit of self-consciousness on my part, it was a significant milestone in my development journey. Here's what I learned:

### Technical Skills Gained:
- **Schema Modeling for PostgreSQL**: I acquired a strong understanding of database schema design and management, a skill that has proven invaluable in subsequent projects.

- **DNS Management**: I learned how to manage domain name systems (DNS) effectively, ensuring seamless navigation for users.

- **Server Setups with Nginx and Docker**: I honed my expertise in configuring servers using Nginx and Docker, a fundamental skill in modern web development and deployment.

### Personal Growth:
- **Entrepreneurship**: Hobby Hunter was my first foray into entrepreneurship, teaching me the importance of innovation and persistence in the business world.

- **Self-Confidence**: Despite its challenges, this project boosted my self-confidence and determination to tackle complex technical problems.

## The Bigger Picture

Though it might not have achieved all I envisioned, Hobby Hunter was the first project I was truly proud of. It was my initial step into the world of entrepreneurship and web development. Looking back, I realize it was the foundation of my technical journey, sparking my curiosity and passion for creating and innovating.

## Conclusion

So, as you read this README, I hope you get a glimpse of who I am through my projects. Hobby Hunter, born from the mind of a young dreamer, may not have conquered the world, but it set the stage for my future endeavors. Today, with a few more years of experience under my belt, I am eager to bring my skills, determination, and unwavering belief in my ideas to a dynamic team at a company like yours.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my journey. The best is yet to come! ðŸŒŸ
